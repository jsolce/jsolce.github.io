<h2>10/6/14</h2>

Last week I had the opportunity to return to my Alma Mater (Go Green!) to recruit new IT interns.  I really enjoy these trips, although they are an exhausting number of hours.  They reinvigorate me by exposing me to people who are excited about my company and the products we offer.  It is nice to ecsape the echo chamber that I can find myself in.</br>

Some takeaways from the trip:</br>

1. Brand Matters</br>

Companies cannot show up on campus once or twice per year, and expect an enthusiastic response from students.  Being there throughout the year is critical.  This does not have to be a full envoy, but a person being there physically or virtually builds credibility.  Even providing a few pizzas for an event or meeting can keep your brand alive in the students' minds.</br>

2. Be Obvious</br>

Unless you're a household name (read: Google), or have a strong brand with the students, you will need to obviously state what types of candidates need apply.  For us, this would be Computer Science or Computer Engineering Juniors.  We didn't have this, and resorted to idly saying "IT", "Computer Science", etc.  Which to me, is equivalent to cold-calling (and just not fun).</br>


3. Be Genuine</br>

A great way to differentiate between yourself and a household name is to give the interested students time.  For us, this is real time spent talking to candidates: at the job fair, dinners, and phone/email.  We were outside in Michigan in October, cracking jokes about the warm southern weather to the folks standing in the Google line.  It shows the students that we are real people, and keeps things fun for us.  When the students do talk to us, we try to give them plenty of time to talk about themselves and learn about us.</br>
