Doing some lightweight (read:notepad) editing today.</br>

My recent tinker was to start using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Glacier as a secondary backup.  My fiance's MacBook of 5 years crashed, without any backups.  I was able to get the drive into a sled, but it was a good wakeup call.</br>
To do this, I installed FastGlacier on my computer, and gathered the files I wanted to backup into compressed folders.</br>
Through the access management in the AWS Management Console, I was able to add a new user account specifically for FastGlacier.  Inputting the access key and secret access key, I was able to simply upload the files to the Glacier.  At this point, my monthly bill is $0.15, and I'm expecting it to stay under a dollar for the foreseeable future.</br>
