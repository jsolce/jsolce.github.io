<b><h2>About me:</h2></b>
I'm a junior software developer, with one year of experience in Java, and now transitioning into C#/.NET, which really means VB and spreadsheets for the moment.</br>
Outside of work, I like to cook, learn, tinker, and play some games - currently FTL.</br>
The purpose of this site is to document the things that I do more regularly and learn more web work through building this.</br>
