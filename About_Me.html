<b><h2>About me:</h2></b>
<div style="width:800px">
I grew up outside a small town in rural Michigan.  In the years leading to my graduation from high school, I was active in Boy Scouts, Band, 4-H, the Envirothon, and Science Olympiad.  Fairly nerdy all around.  Through these groups, I had the opportunity to travel to Canada's Boundary Waters, Florida's Disneyland, Washington D.C., and Maryland.</br></br>

In the Fall of 2003, I began Army Basic Training at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.  While I did not get to see much of the base or local town, I became intimately familiar with the humid afternoons, chilly nights, and hard clay soil.  Mostly from the push-up position. The Army then took me to Fort Hachuca, Arizona, where I trained as a 33W, maintaining military intelligence electronics systems.  In practice, this would be much less technical than it sounds. Once my training was complete, I was stationed in Wurzburg, Germany, in the First Infantry Division.  Within 2 years, we had moved the division back to Fort Riley, Kansas, and redistributed my unit into several other units.  This redistribution included myself, and soon I was headed to Baghdad, Iraq.  I spent 14 months deployed, returned to Kansas, and after a few months left the Army.</br></br>

While I was deployed, I applied to my only school of choice, Michigan State University.  My application essay about international experience was fairly straightforward: I wrote it from a combat zone.  Continuing the professional path that I started in the Army, I majored in Computer Engineering.  After the first Electrical Engineering and Computer Science courses, I promptly changed my major to Computer Science, with a second major in Criminal Justice. Taking a specialization in Science, Technology, the Environment, and Public Policy, I was able to get into a study abroad to Antarctica. This was an amazing experience, and fuels my love of travel. I had a bit of a rocky road academically, but secured internships with USAA and the Michigan State Police, and full time employment as a software developer with USAA.</br></br>

In the past couple of years with USAA, I've developed in Java and Visual Basic, with some exposure to C#, Javascript, and SQL. I've also had the fantastic opportunity to recruit at MSU, working to bring additional IT employees to USAA.</br></br>
