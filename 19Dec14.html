<h2>12/19/14: Release Night</h2>

Yep, we're several hours into release night.</br></br>

While waiting on other teams to do work, we've had a bit of learning about color blindness (one of the tech leads is), and <a href="http://www.blogadilla.com/2008/06/08/are-you-a-tetrachromat/">tetrachromacy</a>.</br></br>

Pizzas and wings have been eaten, coffee and monsters emptied.  Tonight has been one part <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Obama_and_Biden_await_updates_on_bin_Laden.jpg">Situation Room</a>, and one part LAN party.  Executives and management have come and gone, and the developers remain.</br></br>

Calling it a night!
