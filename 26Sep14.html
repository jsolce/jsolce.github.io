I'm far from a super-redditor, but I do enjoy reading from a number of subreddits, and try to skim the first couple of (highly curated) pages daily.  One of the subs that makes the cut is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditDayOf/">r/RedditDayOf/</a>.  Each day it features a new theme, and today's is Esperanto.  This reminded me of a story:</br></br>

I was in the second round interview for the internship that ultimately led to my full time job.  Having majors in computer science and criminal justice, I was exposed to a variety of preparation for interviews.</br>
Towards the beginning of the interview, I was asked "what languages do you know?".</br>
"Just English", I replied, not missing a beat but missing the question in its entirety.</br>
(awkward silence)</br>
Then realizing my mistake, I laughed, they laughed, and I carried on, "mostly C++, with some C, Python, and PHP."  Thankfully I got the internship, and later the job.</br>
