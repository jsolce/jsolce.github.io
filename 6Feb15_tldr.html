<h2>tl;dr Week ending 2/6/15</h2>
<div style="width:800px">
Some interesting articles that I found this week:</br></br>

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2015/01/15/researcher-says-progressive-insurance-dongle-totally-insecure/?utm_content=buffer0f57c&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin.com&utm_campaign=buffer">Hacker Says Attacks On 'Insecure' Progressive Insurance Dongle In 2 Million US Cars Could Spawn Road Carnage</a></br></br>


While the idea of hacked cars running amok is scary and compelling, I don't think this proof of concept reaches that point yet.  In this attack, the dongles themselves would need to be physically compromised, which means that some other part of the supply chain between the manufacturer and the car is insecure. </br>

It appears that Thuen attempted to disclose the vulnerability to Xirgo, the manufacturer (who did not provide comments for the article), but not Progressive. While Xirgo has the responsibility to create secure hardware, Progressive has the most to lose from an insecure system, and could put pressure on their suppliers.</br></br>

This is an interesting new recruitment portal for Federal Technology employees.  While the name and execution draws parallels to the Secret Service, or Peace Corp, I don't think that this will be a specific agency on its own. The profiles at the bottom of the page are from various agencies.  Great recruiting push, and I hope that the Federal Government can build better technology experiences into its systems and services.</br></br>

This was a great bug detective story, how the Polish Language, Communism, Old Habits Dying Hard, and Microsoft Windows came together to prevent S from displaying on Medium.</br>
